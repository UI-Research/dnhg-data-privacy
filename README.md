# Code and Example Data for the "Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods"

This repo/folder contains code used to generate the examples in the "Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods", which can be found [here](XXXX).

**Disclaimer:** Please note that the analyses in this chapter are inspired by real data and public policy analytics but are not representative of them.

## Abstract
President Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies and White House offices to examine barriers to racial equity and initiated several efforts to address equity for people of color and underserved communities. Statistical data privacy (or statistical disclosure control) methods provide a possible solution for researchers or data policy makers with access to data or statistics while preserving participantsâ€™ privacy. These methods try to balance the need for accurate information (utility) against reducing the risk disclosure from what is released; however, standard data privacy methodologies do not explicitly consider racial equity. In this talk, I will introduce a guide that my colleague and I created that provides recommendations for what data privacy methods may be most useful when facing sample size issues that tend to greatly impact underrepresented communities. The report also includes interviews with leading researchers in the data privacy and confidentiality field, where we will seek to understand both how and to what extent they consider the questions of equity in their work. 

## Data
The data are from a Urban research report called, "[Mapping Student Needs during COVID-19](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/mapping-student-needs-during-covid-19)" and can be accessed at [Urban Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.urban.org/dataset/household-conditions-geographic-school-district).
